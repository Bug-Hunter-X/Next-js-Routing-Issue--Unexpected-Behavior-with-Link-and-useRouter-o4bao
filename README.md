# Next.js Routing Issue: Unexpected Behavior with Link and useRouter

This repository demonstrates a potential issue in Next.js applications when using both the `Link` component for navigation and the `useRouter` hook simultaneously in different pages.  The issue manifests as unexpected behavior during client-side routing or page transitions, potentially leading to broken navigation or incorrect state management.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the `pages` directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install necessary dependencies.
4. Start the development server using `npm run dev`.
5. Navigate between the home page and about page using the provided links.

Observe the behavior and potential inconsistencies in navigation.

## Solution

The provided solution focuses on consistent usage of either `Link` or `useRouter` for navigation within the application to maintain predictable and consistent behavior.
